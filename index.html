      <div class="about">
        <p>
          Once upon a time in Jerusalem, I graduated with a BSc in Industrial Engineering &amp; Information Systems,
          destined for spreadsheets and process charts. But destiny had other plans: I became the wizard behind the
          curtain at Tohen Media, conjuring streamlined workflows and automations that made teams cheer (and
          occasionally curse my Python scripts). For the past 3.5 years, I’ve been the CTO &amp; COO of a VR simulation
          realm, crafting immersive worlds where canine heroes of the IDF’s Oketz unit train, leap, and save the
          day—sometimes literally.

          When I’m not building digital kingdoms, you might find me scribbling Hebrew lyrics for an epic ballad,
          researching trauma centers across Israel (because why not?), or experimenting with friendly gluten-free juice
          blends that taste only slightly like sadness.

          <h3>🛡️ CPO, Magnifica VR (2022–Present)</h3>
          <p>
            In a land not so far away, I helm the technological ship of a VR simulation empire that trains the bravest
            canine soldiers of IDF’s Oketz unit. I architect modular simulation frameworks in Unreal Engine, rally a
            squad of developers, artists, and coffee-fueled interns, and deliver training worlds on schedule—while
            occasionally convincing my team that talking goats for stress-relief modules are Totally A Good Idea. The
            result? Canine commandos leap through virtual walls, sniff out hidden threats, and I get to call my job
            “saving the world, one pixel at a time.”

        <div class="exp-item">
          <h3>🏰 CTO, Tohen Media (2018–2022)</h3>
          <p>
            As Tohen Media’s resident tech warlock, I orchestrated web marketing spellbooks and scaled a legion of
            engineers. I introduced automation rituals that boosted efficiency by a mythical 40%, tamed cross-team
            dragons with perfectly plotted roadmaps, and occasionally slipped into Python-induced debugging trance—rumor
            has it I once wrote a script that baked virtual cookies at 2 AM. My proudest feat: convincing everyone that
            “yes, Jenkins pipelines are fun.”

          <h3>💻 IT Specialist, Mashovit (2012–2018)</h3>
          <p>
            In the wild world of Mashovit’s IT jungle, I was the fearless network whisperer—taming rogue servers at
            dawn, convincing the office that “Yes, you actually need six different backups,” and deploying software
            updates faster than you can say “blue screen of death.” I architected infrastructure solutions that kept
            data flowing like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, wrote scripts to automate tedious tasks (because nobody
            should manually reboot eighteen virtual machines at 2 AM), and even managed to charm the CFO into upgrading
            our dusty switch rack by promising “fewer alarm calls at midnight.” All in all, I fell deeper in love with
            the IT craft—every cable run and server rack only fueling my passion to build rock-solid systems that
            (almost) never sleep.

          <h3>🎓 BSc in Industrial Engineering &amp; Information Systems, Jerusalem College of Engineering (2014–2018)
          </h3>
          <p>
            I graduated with honors and a backpack full of dreams (and caffeine stains). My senior project was a
            logistics simulation tool that predicted the future, or at least predicted where boxes should go. I
            specialized in process optimization so intense, people joked I tried to streamline my own sleep schedule
            (spoiler: it didn’t work). This foundation forged my love for systems thinking, and even today, I can’t help
            but diagram the path of my morning coffee from bean to cup.
